**Introduction**
In the age of technology and e-commerce where selling has become more impersonal, feedback from customers now plays a more important role than ever before in both understanding the mood of the consumer as well as in increasing the quality of product or service available. The project analyses the sentiments of Amazon product reviews by using different machine learning models for sentiment analysis. This is a project whose main objective is to classify the positive and negative reviews of customers by some of the machine learning models. The binary classification is of great help in this regard. It helps to understand the sentiments of the customers in a much better way and also to get some insights with respect to the product or service quality at a larger scale (AlQahtani, 2021).

**Data Overview**
The data set contains 4,915 observations (Amazon product reviews) including reviewer's name, overall rating, review text, time of review, and data to indicate if a review was considered helpful. The data contains one missing value in the reviewerName field and one missing value in the reviewText field which were addressed by input "Amanymous" for the missing reviewer name and an “empty” string for the missing reviewText.

**Data Preprocessing**
The first thing we did to prepare the data for training models was to lowercase all the text data. We then formed the data in a manner where we removed URLs, punctuation, and numbers. We also made the data toeknize the text. We did all these to get rid of irrelevant data that would not contribute to the training of the model. We also used the stop words from NLTK to select the stop words that were suitable for the text data. As for the sentiment or the star rating column, apart from leaving it as it is, we also changed it to a binary form. The end result was that 4 and 5 were all considered as 1 and 1, and 2 and 3 were all considered as 0. We made the reviewTime column consistent in the date and time format. Even though we did not use the reviewTime column as one of the features in the model, we still converted it to a consistent format (Dadhich & Thankachan, 2021).

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
Our initial visualizations included a bar chart of the star-rating distribution (shown below) and a heatmap of correlations among numerical features (shown below). The distribution showed a bias towards higher ratings, which is often the case with product review datasets. The correlation heatmap was insightful in terms of understanding how the variables were related to each other, although it did not directly help in model selection.
 
**Model Selection and Evaluation**
We went ahead to select three machine learning model to try out on our dataset, which includes logarithmic regression, random forest classifier, and the support vector machine all with enabling probability estimates for their prediction.Each of the models was included in a pipelines, with TF-IDF vectorizer restraint to 5000 features in order to regulate the memory usage. It is important to cross-validate the model performance with 5 -fold and final evaluation metrics on the test set.

**Model Evaluation and Comparison for Sentiment Classification**
Machine Learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support vector machine were applied to classify the sentiment in amazon product reviews resulting in obtaining high level of Accuracy and consistency is all the three model.LR model produced CV accuracy as 0.917 and Test accuracy as 0.926 with strong metrics such as precision as 0.926 which means 92.6% exact ,Recall as 0.998 which means model is missing 0.1% and dataset model, F1-score (2* Precision * Recall / Precision + Recall) as 0.960 AUC-ROC as 0.962. RF model produced CV accuracy as 0.912 and Test accuracy as 0.913 having precision as 0.913 almost same as Logistic regression and Recall is 0.999 which means it is almost 100%, F1-score as 0.954 and AUC-ROC as 0.931.


It is also noted that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has achieved a higher cross-validation accuracy and DA (0.920 & 0.933) than any of the other models, with a precision of 0.933, A recall of 0.998, F1-score of 0.964 and AUC-ROC of 0.960 – having the best performance between precision and recall It can also be noted that the Naive Bayes generally doesn’t perform very well as its precision/recall tradeoff isn’t as good and therefore the usefulness of the AUC-ROC isn’t relevant. The SVM appears to have scored the highest of all classifiers for sentiment analysis based on the above metrics, including by far the best F1-score (0.964). This is also evident through the confusion matrix, with 15791 of 15816 positive sentiment correctly classified.
 
 
**Deployment and Monitoring**
In order to achieve a high level of accuracy for the live sentiment model, a well organized and structured deployment pipeline is required. The first step is to use a cloud-based machine learning infrastructure, such as AWS or Azure, to deploy a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model that has been trained to recognize the sentiment of a piece of movie review text. These machine learning cloud infrastructures presented as scalable API’s that process incoming text in real-time. By doing this, we keep the bulk of the automated pattern classification, done by the SVM, in the cloud. A lightweight backend server, using Flask or FastAPI, could handle user input to be sent to the cloud to receive sentiment predictions in real-time. We create a dashboard using PowerBI or Tableau for monitoring, or one of the many other real-time, open-source platforms like Grafana. The dashboard visualises metrics like prediction confidence levels, and how the sentiment classifications are distributed over time, plus lots of other metrics. The system should be updated overtime by feeding back new labelled data, checking model drift and retraining the model periodically. We should set up automated alerts for various predictive quality issues, such as if precision or recall drop below a certain value (Patra et al., 2023).

**Conclusion**
The primary objective of this project was to successfully implement sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews using a robust text pre-processing pipeline, building and comparing many different machine learning classifiers, noting that Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the best-performing model based on F1-score and overall accuracy. This project was successful. Future work includes more experiment feature selection using review metadata, experimenting with deep learning models such as LSTM or BERT, and deploying the model in a real-time review monitoring application.
